# Performance Phase — Completion Goal

- **Date:** 2026-06-15
- **Status:** Active. Umbrella goal for the remaining work in the
  [2026-06-12 next-phase proposal](2026-06-12-001-perf-next-phase-proposal.md)
  and the [2026-06-14 frontier/publication narrowing plan](2026-06-14-003-frontier-publication-narrowing-plan.md).
- **Baseline pin:** `swift-tui 30fc38bf` (Stage 0 → 1A → 1A.2 → 1B publication
  narrowing + Stage 2A/2B delta checkpoint restore all landed and pushed), org
  root `main` in sync with `origin/main`.
- **Measurement contract:** release `TermUIPerf`, interaction frames
  (`frame > 1`), same-session A/Bs, `sheet-open-latency` (rows 176) +
  `synthetic-narrow-invalidation` (rows 20/40) as the standing hot pair.

## Goal

Drive the post–Part-A sheet interaction frame from its current ~22 ms/frame
pipeline + ~8 ms/frame of head bookkeeping down toward an **O(changed-subtree)
floor** by closing every remaining ranked residual in the perf workstream —
checkpoint creation, the registration restore-walk, the unconditional animation
and raster walks, and (design-first) the every-frame root force-queue that
causes several of them — **without regressing any of the eight–plus landed wins
or weakening the correctness backstops** (the `.all` publication fallback, the
full-checkpoint oracle, scoped-restore guards, and the island-freshness seam).

The phase is **done** when each item below has either landed with a measured
win and green guards, or been explicitly closed with a recorded reason ("no-op
disproven", "deferred with named owner condition"), and the §4 infrastructure
decisions are recorded rather than left silent.

## Phase status — 2026-06-15 (every item to an evidence-based disposition)

The cheap/safe head-residual levers are exhausted; all converge on one dominant
lever. No `swift-tui` code landed (correctly — the cheap attempt was a measured
no-op); the deliverables are the re-baseline, six evidence-based dispositions,
and a reframing of the dominant lever.

| item | disposition | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 re-baseline | ✅ done | [report](../reports/2026-06-15-perf-phase-rebaseline.md); reconciled a phantom 3× (row-count + battery) |
| A checkpoint create | ⏸️ deferred | cheap reuse = no-op; cost is the O(N) dict build; structural ([finding](../reports/2026-06-15-stage-2c-checkpoint-create-finding.md)) |
| B restore-walk | ✅ closed | median-0 reuse on sheet → walk absent on hot path; narrow-only ([sizing](../reports/2026-06-15-items-b-c-sizing-and-pivot-to-e.md)) |
| C processResolvedTree | ⏸️ deferred | only skippable on unchanged frames; root-eval-bounded; high blast radius |
| D raster | ⏸️ deferred | `raster_ms` 0.74–1.44 ms (2–5.5% frame); worker compute overlapped |
| E frontier narrowing | ✅ design captured | reuse *works* on stable frames; the cost is the toggle cone, not the force-queue ([design](../reports/2026-06-15-item-e-frontier-design-and-reframing.md)) |
| F infra decisions | ✅ recorded | section F below |

**Dominant lever (the session's headline finding):** the ~18 ms full-recompute
sheet frames are driven by the **sheet open/close invalidation cone** (~898
identities), *not* head bookkeeping and *not* the force-queue. Reuse already
works on structurally-stable frames (883/921 reused, 6.4 ms). The genuine next
work is **item 4b — invalidation-cone narrowing** (reader-attribution territory),
which is deep structural work warranting its own carefully-measured effort.

## Scope — the remaining residuals

Per-interaction-frame costs at `30fc38bf`, re-baselined on AC 2026-06-15
([report](../reports/2026-06-15-perf-phase-rebaseline.md)). **Row count matters:**
sheet costs scale ~linearly (~0.025 ms/row of `ckpt_create`), so numbers are
only comparable at identical `TERMUI_PERF_SHEET_TREE_ROWS`. Sheet shown at 44
(default; the Stage 2B / `~1.2ms` reference) and 176 (amplified signal).

| residual | sheet 44 | sheet 176 | narrow 40 | owning item |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| checkpoint **create** p50 (×2/frame) | 1.18 ms | 4.33 ms | 1.06 ms | A (Stage 2C) |
| `restoreRuntimeRegistrations` reuse walk | (in resolve) | (in resolve) | ~0.2–0.5 ms | B (Stage 3) |
| `processResolvedTree` (unconditional) | 0.47 ms | 1.74 ms | 0.58 ms | C |
| raster | (per-frame TSV) | (per-frame TSV) | ~0.75–0.78 ms | D (parallel) |
| root force-queue (upstream cause) | structural | structural | structural | E (design-first) |

Checkpoint **restore** is already Stage-2B-low (0.86 ms @44 / 3.20 ms @176 sheet;
0.54 ms narrow-40) and the `.all` publication restore-node totals (Stage 1B:
−88.8% sheet / −64.6% narrow) are **done** — both serve as no-regression
canaries. The narrow path (narrow-40 total_cpu 0.2412 ≈ documented 0.250) is the
primary canary that must not move.

### A. Stage 2C — checkpoint creation + graph-field copy — DEFERRED 2026-06-15

**Status: parked behind the structural work.** A create-split probe localized the
cost to ~99.9% in the per-node checkpoint dictionary build (graph-field copy is
COW-cheap), and the cheap node-image-reuse lever (Stage 2C.1) measured as a no-op
because it still reconstructs the N-entry dictionary. The only create wins that
remove that O(N) build are structural — a persistent copy-on-mutation
node-checkpoint store (the design doc's deferred high-blast-radius slice) or the
persistent graph/state split — and both compound with Item E. Parked here; full
write-up:
[reports/2026-06-15-stage-2c-checkpoint-create-finding.md](../reports/2026-06-15-stage-2c-checkpoint-create-finding.md).
Probe archived at [docs/perf/checkpoint-create-split-probe/](../perf/checkpoint-create-split-probe/README.md).

The remaining half of the abortable-frame checkpoint cost. Stage 2B scoped
*restore* to proven touched nodes; *create* still snapshots the full graph
(maps, counters, indexes, lifecycle/dependency queues, every node payload)
each abortable frame.
- **Target:** reduce `head_graph_checkpoint_create_p50_ms` (~1.1–1.2 ms both
  scenarios) without regressing the Stage 2B restore win or near-full frames.
- **Constraint:** preserve the `ViewGraphCheckpointTotalityTests` set-equality
  contract and `FrameHeadDraftTransaction` counter-rewind atomicity; keep the
  full checkpoint as oracle/fallback (release: proven delta is final state;
  DEBUG: delta-vs-full oracle).
- **Exit:** create p50 drops on both hot scenarios; abort-rollback equivalence
  tests stay green; budget guard keeps near-full frames on the cheap path.

### B. Stage 3 — `restoreRuntimeRegistrations` reuse-hit walk

The rank-2 resolve residual: a per-reuse-hit recursive walk
(structuralPath-keyed lookup + Set ops + sort) over every retained-reuse
subtree, grown in `8732c8d3`.
- **Sizing first** (cheap, mandatory): a ReuseDenialTrace-style counter on
  walk node-visits/frame before any cache design.
- **Target:** ~0.2–0.5 ms/frame at rows 40 narrow, more on sheet settle, by
  caching the unchanged subtree's registration fragment at its root and
  splicing instead of re-walking (invalidate alongside
  `hasStaleIslandDescendant` / the apply path).
- **Exit:** measured restore-traversal drop on narrow without breaking
  byte-equivalence; promote to its own plan if it needs new totality invariants.

### C. `processResolvedTree` scoping (item 4)

Unconditional full-tree per-identity dictionary build every frame in
`AnimationController.swift`, regardless of whether anything animates.
- **Target:** skip or scope by the frame's dirty/animated identity set
  (~1.30 ms sheet, ~0.35–0.65 ms narrow).
- **Constraint:** the animation-teleport `ViewNodeID` re-key is a prerequisite
  only for identity-scoped *suppression*, not for scoping this walk; H1/H2 +
  animation runtime tests are the guards.

### D. Raster residuals (item 6 — parallel track)

The #2 phase at small trees (~0.75–0.78 ms narrow, flat in rows), fully
decoupled from the resolve/commit chain — the safe parallel-track candidate.
- **Exit:** measured raster reduction at small trees with renderer-output
  equivalence, or explicit deferral.

### E. Frontier narrowing (item 5 — design-first, gates A/C)

The every-frame force-queue of the portal root
(`DefaultRendererFrameHeadCoordinator.swift`) makes every interaction frame a
full top-down spine re-resolve and is the upstream *cause* of A, C, and parts
of the publication cost — it also currently masks the island freshness-cache
hazard.
- **Required before any code:** enumerate every consumer of the root walk's
  incidental guarantees (island staleness masking, registration publication,
  semantic snapshot stability, presentation portal maintenance).
- **Exit:** a written design that names how each guarantee is preserved under a
  narrowed frontier; only then a perf-validated PR. Potentially subsumes parts
  of A and the Stage 1 publication work. Treat animation-tick frames as a
  distinct, under-tested frame class throughout.

### F. §4 infrastructure decisions — RECORDED 2026-06-15

- **Productize the breakdown probes — DECISION: productize, in a dedicated infra
  PR (not inline with a perf win).** This session added a 6th archived probe
  (create-split) and proved its value within the hour (it disproved the Item A
  premise). The reuse-trace (`SWIFTTUI_REUSE_TRACE`) already exists but **did not
  fire on the release perf path** (empty output on sheet) — so step one of the
  infra PR is to fix that gap, then land create-split + a working reuse/cone trace
  as permanent `SWIFTTUI_PROFILE` sub-phase diagnostics. Owner condition: before
  the next checkpoint/resolve optimization that needs sub-phase attribution.
- **Memory occupancy budget — DECISION: not now; watch `memory_growth.tsv`.** No
  retained-state growth landed this session (Item A's per-node checkpoint store
  was *not* built). Revisit when the persistent copy-on-mutation store or the
  graph/state split is taken up (both grow retained state materially).
- **Real-terminal validation — DECISION: still deferred (kitty Route B).** No
  shipped win this session needs real-terminal confirmation (all closures were
  analysis/no-op). Re-affirm when a measured win actually lands.
- **Body re-evaluation cost — DECISION: keep VISION-GAP design-only, but
  ELEVATED relevance.** The Item E reframing shows the sheet-toggle invalidation
  cone re-runs ~898 bodies; cone-narrowing (item 4b) and body re-eval cost are
  the same frontier. Promote to an active investigation if/when item 4b is taken
  up.

## Definition of done (phase exit)

1. **A–C landed** with same-session A/B wins on the hot pair and green focused
   suites + `bazel test //:org_fast`; or each explicitly closed with a recorded
   "no-op disproven" / "deferred (named condition)".
2. **D** landed or deferred on the parallel track.
3. **E** has a written design enumerating the root-walk consumers, with code
   landed only if the design clears them; otherwise recorded as design-complete,
   implementation-deferred.
4. **F** decisions recorded.
5. **No regression:** Stage 1B `.all` restore-node totals and Stage 2B restore
   p50 hold within noise; narrow path (already ~97% scoped) stays flat as the
   canary; full gate green under load.
6. Each landed slice has a completion report under `docs/reports/` and a pin
   bump recorded in this root.

## Standing guardrails (carry into every item)

- **Same-session A/B only**; clean `Tools/TermUIPerf/.build` on any core-struct
  change (stale baselines produced phantom ±10% twice).
- **Struct growth ⇒ clean rebuild everywhere** — a new stored field on
  `ViewGraph`/`ViewNode`/`ResolvedNode`/`EnvironmentValues` SIGBUSes stale
  debug/test objects in destroy paths (hit repeatedly this phase). New
  `ResolvedNode` fields need a `ResolvedNodePhaseOwnershipTests` manifest entry;
  new `ViewNode` fields need `Checkpoint` parity.
- **One flag, one consumer** — staleness signals must not serve both
  reuse-denial and rebuild semantics (the island-split lesson).
- **Animation-tick frames are a distinct frame class** — graph-local dirt, no
  spine re-resolve, no force-root; every reuse/commit/checkpoint change needs a
  guard there (`animationFramesKeepTabHostedPaneSurfaceStable` is the template).
- **`resolve_ms` ≠ resolve cost** — it wraps only `evaluateDirtyNodes`;
  `snapshot()` and the checkpoint pair live in `head_*` columns. Validate on
  total CPU + head columns.
- **Coordination-only probes/overlays never land in a public child repo.**

## Sequencing

0. **Re-baseline ritual** — ✅ done 2026-06-15
   ([report](../reports/2026-06-15-perf-phase-rebaseline.md)).
1. **A (Stage 2C create)** — ⏸️ DEFERRED: cheap lever no-op; structural (section A).
2. **B (restore-walk)** — ✅ CLOSED 2026-06-15, not justified: median-0 reuse on
   sheet (walk absent on hot path), narrow-only ~0.3 ms
   ([sizing](../reports/2026-06-15-items-b-c-sizing-and-pivot-to-e.md)).
3. **C (`processResolvedTree`)** — ⏸️ DEFERRED: only skippable on unchanged-tree
   frames; hot-path walk needed and root-evaluation-bounded; high blast radius.
4. **E (frontier narrowing)** — ✅ DESIGN CAPTURED, implementation deferred
   ([design + reframing](../reports/2026-06-15-item-e-frontier-design-and-reframing.md)).
   Key finding: per-frame data + reuse-trace show the dominant sheet residual is
   the **~18 ms full-recompute frames driven by the sheet-toggle invalidation
   cone** (reuse *works* on stable frames: 883/921 at 6.4 ms). The force-queue
   only governs walk *reach*, not the cone — so E is necessary-but-not-sufficient,
   and the real lever is **item 4b**.
4b. **Invalidation-cone narrowing (the actual sheet lever)** — reduce what the
   sheet open/close toggle invalidates (~898 identities today). Reader-attribution
   / Lever territory (see `sheet-open-latency` memory). Deep structural work;
   next concrete step is a proper reuse/cone diagnostic (the leaf reuse-trace was
   empty → cone-driven, not leaf-denial).
5. **D (raster)** — ⏸️ DEFERRED 2026-06-15 (low-EV): main-thread `raster_ms` is
   0.74 ms narrow / 1.44 ms sheet (2–5.5% of frame), and `worker_raster_compute_ms`
   (5.29 ms) runs on an overlapped worker thread (enqueue 0, off critical path).
   Small win in a deep subsystem; below the cone lever (4b).
6. **F** decisions recorded as items land (the create-split probe is the first
   productizable diagnostic).
